        Question removal can happen due to various reasons. If you have recently submitted
        a new question, it is very likely that it has been rejected. Make sure your submission meets these criteria:

    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item-primary list-group-item"> 
            Similar question has not been submitted before. You can check questions submitted by users

        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item-primary list-group-item"> 
            Your question has the right category and difficulty selected. Make sure to go through all
            categories and difficulty levels to decide which one best suits your question
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item-primary list-group-item">
            The answers to your question are factually correct. Check if the correct answer is definitely correct
            and incorrect answers are all unambiguously incorrect
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item-primary list-group-item">
            The answer fields are filled correctly. For example, if a question has 3 incorrect answers, make sure they are all different
        </li>
